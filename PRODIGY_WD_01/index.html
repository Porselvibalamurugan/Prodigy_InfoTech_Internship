          HTML Structure: Start by creating the basic HTML structure for your
          landing page. This includes the doctype declaration, HTML, head, and
          body tags. In the head section, you can add the title, meta tags, and
          links to external files, such as stylesheets and scripts. The header
          is typically the first thing users see when they visit your landing
          page. It should be visually appealing and include your logo,
          navigation menu, and any important information, such as your tagline
          or value proposition. <br />
          CSS Styling: 
          Use CSS to style your navigation menu. You can customize the
          font, colors, spacing, and layout of the menu items. To make the
          navigation menu fixed and visible on all pages, you can use the CSS
          position property with a value of "fixed". This will keep the menu in
          a fixed position even when the user scrolls down the page. To change
          the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or
          when a menu item is hovered over, you can use CSS transitions or
          JavaScript event listeners to add interactivity.
          <br/>
          JavaScript Interactivity: 
          Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your navigation
          menu. You can use event listeners to detect when the user scrolls or
          hovers over a menu item, and then change the background color or font
          color accordingly. You can also use JavaScript to toggle a class on
          the menu items when they are hovered over, which can trigger CSS
          transitions or animations. This will create a visually engaging and
          interactive navigation experience for your users .
